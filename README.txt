Summary

Module 1 Agent Based Modelling: One .py file with basic code creating 2 agents in a rondom position and further moving them 
in a step in a random position. The code prints the final position as answer

Module 2 Code shrinking: One .py file which attempts to start shrinking the code and creating some 
complexity to the model. A list of agents is created in which to append the agents various opearations
in the code attempt into displaying the gents as coordinates and also wothin a plotted graph. 

Module 3 Code Shrinking 2: One .py file. In this code the code is effectively shrunk and given various 
complexities, various agents are added to the list and each agent is given various iterations of movements 
instead of the original one. 

Module 4 Building tools: One .py file. This module builds on the previous by giving a further dimension to 
the gants' list. Some tests are also made in lieu of the newly added complexities, including the timing of 
program execution 

Module 5 Agents: Two .py files. In this exercise some of the agentframework functions of the model are transferred 
on a separate file to present a neater and more concise. For this exercise the agent framework file was limited to 
creating the agents and moving them to them to be later transfered to the actual model (.py).

Module 6 IO: Two .py files and a text file containing environment data. In this module the agentframework is further 
devolped by adding the interaction betweeb agebt and environment. The environment had been added by using the csv 
module to convert csv data on a txt document. The final presentation displays the agents moving in the environment. 

Module 7 COMM: Same 3 files as before. The new adjustments to the model allow agents to not only eating from the 
environment but also to interact and basically avoid each other 

Module 8 Animation: Same 3 files as before. This concludes the animation part by further creating an animation which now 
includes he agents and showing their effect on the environment

Module 9 Gui/Web-Scraping: Same 3 files as before. This last part of the asssignment builds up on the previous, and adds a 
Graphic User Interface which is intended to host and manage the model, while the previously randomised data regarding
the starting location of agents has now been de-randmised by using data from a website.
